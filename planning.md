# Planning

Needs to:

- Generate mazes via server call - with skeletons
- Select programming language
- Have a nice editor
- Work on multiple screen sizes

Setup process

1. Create account
   Username and PIN
   Note that it is temporary, and likely won't be used for future stuff.

2. Preferences
   Select default language
   Editor themes?
   Maybe an option to disable grid lines? (who would want to though?)
